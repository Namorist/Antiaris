[i/s1:75] [c/51DA5F:What is Antiaris?]
Antiaris is a new project from part of team which made Tremor Mod. The difference is that content in Antiaris is more interesting, balanced and unique, unlike in Tremor, basically "Quality > Quantity".
Our team is trying to make the game bigger and make the player feel more interested in game.
